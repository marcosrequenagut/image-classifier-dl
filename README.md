# Image Classification with Transfer Learning and Segmentation

This project focuses on using transfer learning to classify images into 4 distinct categories. We begin by utilizing a pre-trained model, which is adapted to our custom dataset to improve the classification accuracy. The goal is to not only classify the images but also perform image segmentation, predicting the class for each segment of an image.

## Objectives

- **Transfer Learning**: Use a pre-trained model to fine-tune it for our dataset of 4 classes.
- **Segmentation**: Divide a single image into smaller patches and predict the class of each patch using the trained model.
- **Better Results**: Achieve higher accuracy through transfer learning and segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains images categorized into four classes. The classes represent different types of objects (e.g., animals, plants, etc.). The images are preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets using a Python script. This is to ensure that the model does not have access to the testing data during the training process.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and organize the dataset into training and testing directories.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Load a pre-trained deep learning model and fine-tune it on our dataset.
3. **Segmentation**: Divide input images into smaller segments and classify each segment.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using test data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Keras/TensorFlow (for deep learning)**
- **OpenCV (for image segmentation)**
- **Matplotlib (for data visualization)**

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classifier-dl.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and perform segmentation.

## How It Works

1. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using a Python script that ensures a correct split without data leakage.
2. **Training the Model**: A pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16) is fine-tuned on the dataset.
3. **Image Segmentation**: For each image, it is divided into smaller regions. The model then classifies each segment, allowing for multi-class classification within a single image.

## Model Evaluation

The model’s performance is evaluated on a test set to determine how accurately it can classify the segments. Additionally, metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices are used to assess the model’s effectiveness.

## Conclusion

By leveraging transfer learning and image segmentation, we can achieve higher classification accuracy on complex datasets. This approach not only improves model performance but also adds flexibility by enabling the prediction of multiple classes within a single image.
